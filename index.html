                            Jac's marketing department has been inundated by their clients, both past and present, with
                            the fact that their children and children of their friends have been intrigued and
                            interested in the places that they have ventured. In order to meet this interest, marketing
                            has decided to create for children, aged 6 to 13, an education application that exposes
                            children to the various aspects science, art, and history. All of these areas of studies

                            Food and water and playtime aren’t enough anymore. The virtual cats are chasing the virtual
                            dogs. The virtual organic animals are letting nature take its course in every corner, while
                            the virtual robotic pets are getting rusty. Let’s just say things are piling up.
                            <br><br>
                            Thanks to the generosity of donors, leashes aren’t an issue, so you can walk all of your
                            virtual dogs at once. This is great, since they are less like to soil their cages if walked
                            regularly. Did I mention dogs are in cages now? Yeah, it keeps the cats from chasing them.
                            Better keep those cages and litter boxes clean and your robotic pets well oiled!
